### Pookalam Description
my pookalam is a type of art that is moving like a circle with different colours of petals.



### Technologies are css,html and javascript functions


### I build the pookalam using some javascript functions,css and html and also from chatgpt. I made the changes in the colours,width,shapes and in the way of forming a simple pookalam.
I had linked the extensions css and javascript to index.html to reveal in ms Edge.
